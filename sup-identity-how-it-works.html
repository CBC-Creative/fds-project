            <h1>Identity Theft: How it Works</h1>
            <h2>Identity Fraud vs. Identity Theft</h2>
            <p>
              Approximately 8.1 million Americans or 3.5% of the total U.S. population learned that
              they were victims of identity fraud in 2010.* Identity fraud is the use of someone
              else's personal information for gain-the act of obtaining that information is the work
              of identity thieves.
            </p>

            <p>
              However, many acts of identity fraud are not committed by identity thieves. Identity
              thieves often harvest as much personal information as they can and sell it to the
              highest bidder. That is why an act of identity fraud once discovered, is often far
              removed from the actions of the identity thief who acquired your personal information.
            </p>

            <h2>Document Shredding for Identity Protection</h2>
            <p>
              Even in our digitized world, physical documents accounted for 43% of all identity
              theft, while online methods accounted for only 11% in 2009.* We often don't realize
              how much personal information is contained in documents we discard. A habit of
              regularly shredding documents is one of the easiest ways to prevent identity theft.
              But paper is so prominent in our everyday lives, what exactly do we need to shred?
            </p>
            <h2>Anatomy of an Identity Theft, or What's In Your Dumpster?</h2>
            <p>
              Identity thieves can piece together your identity from discarded documents found at
              one location, sometimes in the same garbage bag.
            </p>
