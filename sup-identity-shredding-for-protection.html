            <h2 class="choosing-sub-title mt-4">To Shred Or Not to Shred…</h2>
            <p>A good shredder will destroy all pre-approved credit card application materials including the faux card that sometimes is included.</p>
            <p>Old records may seem harmless enough; for example, closed credit cards and bank accounts. But an ambitious identity thief can use the bits and pieces of this old information to assemble a profile of your current identity. If you are unsure that a document needs to be shredded—shred it!</p>

            <h2 class="choosing-sub-title mt-4">Best Practices for Office Shredding</h2>
            <p>A proactive approach is vital in office identity security, particularly when it comes to paper documents, which can easily be overlooked when you’re focusing on digital security measures. Paper applications filled out by employees, e-mail attachments that have been printed out, and even handwritten notes about your competition all require protection.</p>

            <ol class="order-list-supplement-page">
              <li>Use <a href="#" class="text-yellow" target="blank">Small Office/Home Office shredder</a> or <a href="#" class="text-yellow" target="blank">Commercial Cross-Cut shredder</a>, depending on the size of your office, for optimum shredding performance. Choose a cross-cut shredder that can also be used as a credit card shredder, DVD shredder or a shredder for documents with paper clips and staples so you can destroy more than paper documents.</li>
              <li>Position shredders near copiers/printers for quick and easy shredding of documents that might be left out on the paper tray.</li>
              <li>Maintain strict requirements for shredding all customer printed materials the moment they are no longer needed. Printed customer documentation should be shredded regardless of the nature of the content. This prevents time wasted reviewing documents for personal information or personal content being overlooked.</li>
              <li>Shred all printed employee documentation once it is no longer needed. The same rules for customers, applies to employees. Diligent shredding prevents any personal information about employees from being misplaced. Be sure to use a credit card shredder for destroying expired company credit cards.</li>
              <li>Make employees aware of shredding practices and how the shredders are used so they will feel comfortable using them.</li>
           </ol>
           <h2 class="choosing-sub-title mt-4">FACTA Compliance</h2>
            <p class="mb-0">The Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act or FACTA requires all businesses to follow simple guidelines for protecting and disposing of sensitive data collected from customers. To adhere to FACTA rules you must maintain a written policy for document shredding that is presented to employees. Train your employees in the proper disposal of documents containing sensitive information so they understand the importance of the policy. Make sure you have the best shredders and enough paper shredders, and a credit card shredder if needed, to accommodate the amount of materials that need to be destroyed on a regular basis at the workplace.</p>
