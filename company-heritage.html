                <p class="bigptext">
                  Born in Ohio in 1879, Harry Fellowes was the youngest of nine children and left
                  school to support his family at age 15, working alongside his father on a textile
                  assembly line. Harry was quickly identified as a high-potential employee and
                  worked his way to the front office learning the tailoring trade. Following his
                  father's death in his early 20's, Harry relocated his family to Chicago, Illinois
                  where he started his own tailoring business. The entrepreneurial lifestyle seemed
                  to fit Harry and he took to the apparel industry naturally, distinguished as a
                  smart and fashionable dresser.

                <p class="bigptext">
                  Operating out of the Lees Building in downtown Chicago, Harry came to know another
                  entrepreneur and business owner on his floor, Walter Nickel. A salesperson turned
                  inventor, Walter had recently innovated the Liberty Record Storage Box, which met
                  a developing need for paper storage following the introduction of new
                  records-keeping legislation. Shortly after launching his new idea, Walter received
                  a notice letter from the military informing him of being drafted into World War I.
                  A casual conversation between Walter and Harry became life-changing as Harry
                  proposed that he leave his tailor business, acquire Walter's idea for $121, and
                  make Walter a 50/50 partner when he returned from the war. Harry's proposal was
                  accepted.

                  Harry's first task was to file a patent on the Liberty Box and register the new
                  name of the business, The Bankers Box Company. With demand growing, the business
                  began to take shape hiring its first 5 employees who would collectively go on to
                  serve 208 years, more than a 40-year average apiece. With an established
                  manufacturing capability, Harry set out across the United States on multi-day
                  trips, building a dealer base of resellers who fell in love with the new
                  opportunity. Experiencing increasing momentum and growth, the fledgling start-up
                  faced a new, sobering challenge on Black Tuesday in October of 1929.

                <p class="bigptext">
                  Following the plunge of the Dow Jones by 89% and the new reality of an economic
                  crash, Harry and Walter quickly made adjustments to meet a shrinking market
                  demand. To preserve as much work as possible for existing employees, a pay cut was
                  activated for all owners and employees. Sensitive to the hard times, the Bankers
                  Box Company also started the practice of providing free soup and coffee each day.
                  With banks, the company's primary customer, facing peril the Great Depression
                  accelerated efforts to grow a more diverse and far-reaching customer base. To
                  achieve this, Harry's oldest son, Folger, left college in his Senior year to help
                  his father expand the businesses regions. Harry's other son, John, joined the
                  business shortly thereafter. By the end of the decade, the business achieved
                  record orders and regained its momentum, but a new challenge was on the horizon:
                  World War II.

                <p class="bigptext">
                  With Harry's two sons, Folger and John now serving in the military, Harry and
                  Walter had a fundamental challenge that required their concentrated focus,
                  procuring raw materials. With wartime policies tightly rationing materials like
                  corrugate, which represented 98% of Bankers Box contents, Harry negotiated a
                  reoccurring audience with The War Production Board in Washington, D.C. There he
                  highlighted his role in supporting the war effort through supplying Defense
                  Contractors and the benefits of substituting corrugated for other more precious
                  wartime substrates like metal. His effort and logic were rewarded with consecutive
                  6-month allowances, which increased access to corrugate and allowed the business
                  to continue operations through the war period. The idea of substituting corrugate
                  went further than he could have imagined, including the use of Liberty Boxes as
                  bassinets by hospitals.

                  With sales exceeding $1M for the first time at the start of the decade, brothers
                  Folger and John Fellowes assumed the President and Vice President roles
                  respectively. To establish a new foundation for increased demand, Bankers Box
                  moved outside of Chicago to Franklin Park. The product line was also expanded with
                  the reintroduction of STAXONSTEEL®, after being discontinued during World War II
                  due to its metal content. Later, the R-Kive® box was introduced, still a
                  best-seller to this day.

                  As the Bankers Box Company continued to emerge from a regional to national company

                  building 5 regional plants and sales offices across the nation began to take shape
                  which created stronger customer relationships and enhanced, quicker services.

                  Following the sudden and heartbreaking death of his older brother Folger, John
                  became the company's third President and primary shareholder at the start of the
                  decade. With his son, Jamie, now alongside him in the business, a new horizon and
                  vision for the business began, international expansion. With stability and an
                  established brand in the office products industry, Canada and the United Kingdom
                  became Bankers Box's first international subsidiaries. Led by the father and son
                  team, two local entrepreneurs were selected, and new teams were created to operate
                  local factories and build capabilities which could serve these different market
                  landscapes. Back home, the Bankers Box Company had outgrown its Franklin Park
                  headquarters and built a new state-of-the-art facility 25 miles outside of Chicago
                  in Itasca, Illinois.

                <p class="bigptext">
                  In 1983 Harry's grandson, Jamie, became the company's fourth President. Observing
                  trends in offices, it became clear that workspaces were taking new shape around
                  the prevalence of personal computers and the management of paper records. A vision
                  was cast to reach the existing Bankers Box users and customers with complimentary
                  products around this emerging workspace. Feeling that the Bankers Box brand was
                  limiting in its connection to paper storage, the company introduced a new brand
                  that could be positioned broader, Fellowes®. Throughout the decade shredders,
                  media storage, computer accessories, ergonomic products, and other categories were
                  added to the company's offering under the Fellowes brand. As the business
                  continued to grow in scale and complexity, Jamie turned to his older brother to
                  help lead the business. In 1989, Peter Fellowes joined the company.

                <p class="bigptext">
                  Jamie and Peter worked as a team, with Jamie focusing on building the global
                  marketplace and Peter concentrating most of his efforts on internal operations.
                  The Fellowes brand continued to expand through acquisition, but its most
                  significant growth came from a new internally developed invention: the personal
                  shredder. Leveraging its manufacturing and product development know-how, Fellowes
                  designed and created the first shredder which retailed under $100. Making the
                  product more accessible, the application of shredders moved from multi-user
                  machines to a convenient extension of the individual workspace. Meanwhile, Peter
                  led a new transformational initiative called “Advantage Fellowes”. This internal
                  process brought meaningful enhancements to Fellowes' competitiveness through the
                  framework of LEAN operations and Kaizen processes. With a broader base, Fellowes
                  gained more attention from the global industry. Business partners across Europe,
                  Asia, and Australia were formed as Fellowes' presence expanded from 3 to 9
                  countries.

                  Fellowes's success in shredders presented a new opportunity for global leadership
                  in a growing category. Further fueling the category, identity theft emerged as a
                  household term and shredders became one of the first lines of defense. With a
                  far-reaching product line, Fellowes identified its shredder category as its lead
                  product to shape its new brand equity. Joining the business in 2001, John Fellowes
                  II, joined his father, Jamie, and they partnered to bring strong leadership in
                  this emerging category. Adopting the bulldog as the symbol of protection and
                  trust, the brand took a new shape around technical innovation and differentiating
                  quality, ultimately introducing the first jam-proof shredder.

                  By 2010, technology had transformed the way people worked and bought office
                  products - reshaping workplaces and work behavior. With John Fellowes II becoming
                  its next President and CEO, it was a natural time to determine a generational
                  vision for the business. Throughout the decade, Fellowes expand into new
                  categories and recast the positioning of its brand from shredders to include
                  vibrant and emerging professional categories like air purification and furniture
                  solutions which promoted health and productivity in new ways. New expansionary
                  products were developed through expanding Fellowes internal teams and building new
