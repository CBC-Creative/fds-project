Growing up working on an assembly line rather than attending school, Harry Fellowes transformed his life from meager beginnings to a life of excellence and influence. Today, Fellowes remains owned and led by the Fellowes family into its 4th generation of leadership. Starting with the original Bankers Box, Fellowes has expanded into broad based solutions that bring productivity, wellness and inspiration into WorkLife across the world.</p>

                      <p class="bigptext">Born in Ohio in 1879, Harry Fellowes was the youngest of nine children and left school to support his family at age 15, working alongside his father on a textile assembly line. Harry was quickly identified as a high potential employee and worked his way to the front office learning the tailoring trade and, following his father’s death, relocated his family to Chicago, Illinois where he started his own tailoring business.</p>

                    <p class="bigptext">Operating out of the Lees Building in downtown Chicago, Harry came to know another entrepreneur and business owner Walter Nickel. A salesperson turned inventor, Walter had recently developed the Liberty Record Storage Box, which met a developing need for paper storage following the introduction of records keeping legislation. Shortly after launching his new idea, Walter received notice of being drafted into World War I. A casual conversation between Walter and Harry turned lifechanging as Harry proposed that he leave his tailor business, acquire Walter’s idea for $127 and make Walter a 50/50 partner when he returned from the war. This was the beginning of the Bankers Box Company.</p>

                  <p class="bigptext">Harry’s first order was to file a patent on the Liberty Box and register the new name of the business, Bankers Box Company. With demand growing, the business began to take shape hiring its first 5 employees who would collectively go on to serve 208 years, more than a 40-year average apiece. With an established manufacturing capability, Harry set out across the United States on multi-day trips, building a dealer base of resellers who fell in love with the new opportunity. Experiencing increasing momentum and growth, Black Tuesday, October 1929, brought sobering challenges to the fledgling start-up.</p>

                <p class="bigptext">Following the plunge of the Dow Jones by 89% and the new reality of an economic crash, Harry and Walter quickly made adjustments to meet a shrinking market demand. In order to preserve as much work as possible for existing employees, a pay cut was activated for all owners and employees. Sensitive to the hard times, the Bankers Box Company also started the practice of providing free soup and coffee each day. With banks as the company’s main customer facing peril, the Great Depression accelerated urgency to grow a more diverse and far-reaching customer base. Harry’s oldest son, Folger, left college to help his father run the business and his other son, John, joined the business shortly after. By the end of the decade the business achieved record orders and regained its momentum, but a new challenge was on the horizon, World War II.</p>

              <p class="bigptext">With Harry’s two sons, Folger and John now serving in the military, Harry and Walter had a fundamental challenge that required their concentrated focus, getting materials. With wartime policies tightly rationing materials like corrugate which represented 98% of Bankers Box contents, Harry negotiated a reoccurring audience with The War Production Board in Washington, D.C., highlighting his business with Defense Contractors and the benefits of the substitution of corrugated rather than metal products, the most valuable material during WWII. His effort and logic were rewarded with increased access to corrugate. The idea of substituting for other materials went further than he could have imagined, including the receipt of orders for Liberty Boxes to be used as bassinets by hospitals.</p>

              <p class="bigptext">With sales exceeding $1M for the first time at the start of the decade, brothers Folger and John Fellowes assumed the President and Vice President roles, respectively. In order to establish a new foundation and increased space, Bankers Box moved outside of the city of Chicago to Franklin Park, Illinois. New record storage products were introduced including Stax-on-Steel and R-Kive, which remain in Bankers Box’s product line today. The cornerstone Liberty Box was also redesigned to enable more efficient manufacturing and to meet the needs of changing work environments.</p>

With his son, Jamie, now alongside him in the business, a new horizon and vision for the business began, international expansion. With stability and an established brand in the office products industry, Canada and the United Kingdom became Bankers Box’s first international subsidiaries. Led by Jamie, two local entrepreneurs were selected and a new team which operated a local factory and capabilities to serve a different market landscape were formed. Back home, the Bankers Box Company had outgrown its Franklin Park headquarters and built a new state- of-the-art facility 25 miles outside of Chicago in Itasca, Illinois.</p>

Observing trends in offices, workspaces started to take shape in new ways around the prevalence of personal computers and the management of paper records. The idea was developed to reach the existing Bankers Box users and customers with complimentary products around the emerging workspace. A new brand was launched, Fellowes, which represented a more progressive positioning. Throughout the decade shredders, media storage, ergonomic products and others were added to the company’s offering. Increasing in complexity, Jamie turned to his older brother to help lead the business. In 1989, Peter Fellowes became the company’s fifth President and Jamie took the title of CEO.</p>

              <p class="bigptext">Jamie and Peter worked as a team, with Jamie focusing on the global marketplace and Peter concentrating his efforts on internal capabilities and continuous improvement. The Fellowes brand continued to expand its product line through acquisition, but its largest growth came from a new internally developed invention, the personal shredder. Leveraging its manufacturing and product development knowhow, Fellowes designed and created the first shredder to retail under $100, which opened up a new possibility of convenient shredding for the individual office worker. Meanwhile, Peter led a new transformational initiative at Fellowes, Advantage Fellowes. This internal process brought transformational enhancement to Fellowes competitiveness through the framework of LEAN operations and Kaizen processes. With a broader base, Fellowes gained more attention from the global industry, and business partners across Europe, Asia and Australia were formed, expanding Fellowes’ presence from 3 to 15 countries.</p>

              <p class="bigptext">Fellowes success in shredders presented a new opportunity for global leadership in a growing category. Further fueling the category, identity theft became a household term and shredders became one of the first lines of defense. With a broad product line, Fellowes identified its shredder line as its lead product to shape the brand. Joining the business in 2001, John Fellowes II, joined his father Jamie to create leadership in this developing category. Adopting the bulldog as the symbol of protection and trust, the brand took new shape around technical innovation and differentiating quality, ultimately introducing the first jam proof shredder.</p>

              <p class="bigptext">By 2010, technology had transformed the way people worked and how they bought office products. Office w0rkers used nearly half as much paper as just a decade earlier and smart digital devices created a mobile nature to the work environment. Further shifting behavior, ecommerce increased the competition and selection with the introduction of the ‘endless aisle’. With John becoming Fellowes President and CEO, a generational renovation of the brand and company began, pursuing new solutions to support greater productivity, wellness and inspiration to professional workers, Fellowes developed new commercial air purification solutions and furniture which created greater movement in the workstation. Fellowes also acquired 4 companies which provided access to contract industries.</p>
