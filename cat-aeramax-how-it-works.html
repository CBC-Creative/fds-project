                    The active carbon filter works to adsorb odors and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as cleaning agents, vapors from office equipment, and pesticides. Our commercial-grade carbon particle filters have more carbon content and surface area than typical consumer-grade carbon-impregnated weaves. This means they are designed to keep performance during their defined lifespan. While carbon filters remove odors and VOCs, they do not on their own remove dust and other allergens.

                  True HEPA filtration with antimicrobial treatments remove 99.97 percent of airborne particles at 0.3 microns while preventing bacteria and fungi build up. The antimicrobial treatment also kills any mold or mildew that can grow on the filter. True HEPA filtration removes dust, pollen, mold spores, dust mites, allergens, and many other bacterias. It is proven to be most effective compared to UV air purifiers, UV-C disinfection or Ultra-Violet Germicidal Irradiation (UVGI).

              PlasmaTRUE technology creates an electrical discharge that produces ions in the air… and those ions provoke particles in the air to be charged. These charged ions cause other oppositely charged ions to cluster together and become larger. When they become large enough, they fall to the floor or get caught in the filter. AeraMax Pro uses ionization to help with its filtration process’s overall efficiency, purifying the air even before it gets to the filter. By doing so, PlasmaTRUE technology works to extend filter life.

                <p>
                  Many air purifiers require the user to know their air quality and make manual adjustments to the system. This normally results in other commercial air purifiers running at their lowest fan speed and not truly boosting the air quality.
                </p>
                <p>Fellowes commercial grade air purifiers are the only purifiers that respond directly to detected occupancy in your space and air conditions - being truly proactive.</p>
                <p>EnviroSmart Technology works by utilizing an array of self-regulating sensors to continuously monitor contaminants, room occupancy and noise levels. These sensors allow AeraMax Pro air purifiers to work proactively, continuously monitoring the space as people move throughout.</p>
                <p>Our patented and proprietary technology does this by continuously scanning the room. As people enter the space, AeraMax Pro EnviroSmart immediately works to increase the airflow rate to quickly purify the air. As people leave, it shifts to standby mode, conserving energy and extending filter life. Comparatively, other commercial-grade air purifiers that include sensors only respond to things like odor and particles in the air.</p>
                <p class="mb-5">AeraMax Pro EnviroSmart sensors continuously monitor the air, ensuring peace of mind that it's cleaning as hard as you need it - when you need it.</p>

        <h2 class="page-title fw-300 mb-3">PureView™ Technology</h2>
        <p class="bigptext pb-4">PureView's patented sensor technology and display makes the invisible visible with real time status updates as the air is cleaned. It provides maximum peace of mind that the air you and others breathe is clean.</p>

              <div class="how-it-work-content-title mb-3">How it Works</div>
              <p>
                As EnviroSmart sensors monitor room occupancy, odor, and contaminants to immediately purify the air or conserve energy, PureView displays the room status with the percent of particles being cleaned from the air. It also displays PM2.5, VOC, and maintenance notifications.
              </p>
              <p>PureView’s display is powered by dual self-regulating sensors that check the air quality as it enters and exits the air purifier. By measuring the particle count, AeraMax Pro ensures the air you breathe is 99.97 percent clean.</p>
              <p class="mb-0">Other commercial air purifier sensors need regular cleaning. AeraMax Pro air purifiers use higher-quality maintenance-free sensors that are less likely to get clogged. These sensors then consistently maintain their ability to check particles over time. As the sensors monitor particles, the display provides visual proof to room occupants that the air being breathed is clean.</p>

            <div class="how-it-work-content-title mb-3">PM 2.5</div>
            <p>The PureView display shows the current PM2.5 particle count.</p>

            <p>PM2.5 are pollutants that are 2.5 microns or less in size. PM2.5 is the industry standard for air quality measurement by the EPA and World Health Organization.</p>
            
            <p>According to the EPA, PM (particulate matter) is the term for a mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets found in the air. Particles such as dust, dirt or smoke are large or dark enough to be seen with the naked eye. Others are so small they can only be detected using an electron microscope. Small particles pose a concern that they can get deep into your lungs and some even into your bloodstream.</p>
            
            <p>The RESET Air Quality Standard, or RESET Air, is a data standard for air quality monitoring and is a module of the RESET Standard. They break the standard into two levels: acceptable and high performance. Acceptable is <35μg/m3, in line with what PureView defines as “Moderate” and high performance is <12μg/m3 which is in line with what PureView defines as “Clean”.</p>
            
            <p>Even further, the International Well Building Institute has a global standard/certification program that covers multiple aspects of how building design, operations, and behaviors can benefit occupant health. Their standard rewards buildings with a PM2.5 level below 15μg/m3. AeraMax Pro can help buildings meet these standards as part of their air protection plan by cleaning down to levels of <12μg/m3.</p>

          <div class="how-it-work-content-title mb-3">VOCs</div>
          <p>PureView also provides a readout of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). VOCs are emitted as gases from certain solids or liquids—even newly installed carpeting and new office furniture.</p>
          <p class="mb-5">According to the EPA, organic chemicals are widely used as ingredients in household products. Some of these products include paints, varnishes, waxes, and many cleaning, disinfecting, cosmetic, degreasing, and hobby products. All these products can release organic compounds while you’re using them, even when they are stored. They cause various health effects, including eye, nose, and throat irritation, headaches, and more.</p>
          <div class="how-it-work-content-title mb-3">Operations & Maintenance Notifications</div>
          <p class="mb-0">For operational purposes, PureView provides an alert when it’s time to replace the filter. Other air purifiers determine when to change a filter based on time, but AeraMax Pro takes it one step further. It measures by time, run rate and how much air is being pulled through the machine. That most effective measurement technique dictates when filters need to be changed, extending filter life and lowering operational cost.</p>
