                      <div class="fw-700 mb-3">What is the ACH Rating?</div>
                      <ul class="px-3 preg12">
                        <li>ACH stands for “Air Changes per Hour” and is one of the least understood ratings on air purifiers.
                          The ACH rating indicates how many times per hour an air purifying device can exchange the air
                          within a room. For example, an ACH rating of 5x means that the full air volume is exchanged
                          five times every hour.</li>
                        <li>All air purifiers display a Cubic Feet per Minute (CFM) number under the specifications. If you
                          multiply the CFM by 60 (minutes per hour) and divide by 8 feet (average ceiling height). Then
                          divide that total by the ACH rating, you’ll end up with the maximum square footage number for
                          the air purifier.</li>
                        <li>Air changes per hour, or air change rate, abbreviated ACH or ACPH, is a measure of the air
                          volume added to or removed from a space (normally a room or house) divided by the volume
                          of the space. If the air in the space is either uniform or perfectly mixed, air changes per hour is a
                          measure of how many times the air within a defined space is replaced.</li>
                        <li>To estimate the coverage needed, divide the hourly air delivery rate of the unit by the total
                          cubic feet of the room. The CDC recommends 5 air changes per hour.</li>

                          <li>Generally, HVAC does not run continuously in all spaces. HVAC systems stop when the room
                            reaches thermostat temperature, since they’re designed to be efficient at heating/cooling. Only
                            10-20% of fresh air makes it into the building, while 80-90% is recirculated air. Additionally, a
                            standard MERV-13 filter found in HVAC systems provide insufficient capture rates: 50% effective
                            at .3 microns (according to ASHRAE) vs Fellowes’ H13 True HEPA filters which capture at least
                            99.95% of particles as small as 0.1 microns. CDC, ASHRAE, and the White House all recommend
                            adding a HEPA air purifier where HVAC is unable to meet air quality needs.</li>

                                   Total coverage of an Array Signal is heavily determined by a building’s airflow as well as the presence of physical barriers. For example, a space with adequate airflow (4-6 ACH) can be measured by one Array Signal (up to 5,382 sq ft) as long as it’s placed in the “breathing zone” (above 3’ and below 6’) and not obstructed with any physical barriers. Note: If your building is seeking a RESET certification, see this for specific requirements regarding sensor placement and monitoring requirements.

                            The most common form of UV radiation is sunlight, which produces three main types of UV rays: UVA, UVB, UVC.

                         <li>
                            UVA rays have the longest wavelengths, followed by UVB, and UVC rays which have the shortest wavelengths. While UVA and UVB rays are transmitted through the atmosphere, all UVC and some UVB rays are absorbed by the Earth’s ozone layer.

                         <li>
                            UVA – Ultraviolet A enhances the harmful effects of ultraviolet B radiation and is also responsible for some photosensitivity reactions; it is used therapeutically in the treatment of a variety of skin disorders.

                         <li>
                            UVB – Ultraviolet B causes sunburn and several damaging photochemical changes within cells, including damage to DNA, leading to premature aging of the skin, premalignant and malignant changes, and a variety of photosensitivity reactions; it is also used therapeutically for treatment of skin disorders.

                            UVC – Ultraviolet C radiation is the highest energy portion of the UV radiation spectrum. UVC radiation from the sun does not reach the earth’s surface because it is blocked by the ozone layer in the atmosphere. Thus, the only way that humans can be exposed to UVC radiation is from an artificial source like a lamp or laser

                            According to the FDA, UVC radiation is a known disinfectant for air, water, and nonporous surfaces. UVC radiation has effectively been used for decades to reduce the spread of bacteria, such as tuberculosis. For this reason, UVC lamps are often called “germicidal” lamps. UVC radiation has been shown to destroy the outer protein coating of the SARS-Coronavirus. UVB and UVA radiation is expected to be less effective than UVC radiation at inactivating the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.
                         </li>
                         <li>
                            There is some evidence that UVB radiation is effective at inactivating other SARS viruses (not SARS-CoV-2). However, it is less effective than UVC at doing so and is more hazardous to humans than UVC radiation because UVB radiation can penetrate deeper into the skin and eye. UVB is known to cause DNA damage and is a risk factor in developing skin cancer and cataracts.
                         </li>
                         <li>
                            UVA radiation is less hazardous than UVB radiation but is also significantly (approximately 1000 times) less effective than either UVB or UVC radiation at inactivating other SARS viruses. UVA is also implicated in skin aging and risk of skin cancer.

                         <li>
                            According to the EPA, given sufficient exposure time and lamp power, UV light can penetrate the outer structure of a microorganism’s cell(s) and alter its DNA, preventing replication and causing cell death.

                            EPA recommends that consumers take advantage of available local options for recycling CFLs, fluorescent bulbs and other bulbs that contain mercury, and all other hazardous wastes, rather than disposing of them in regular trash.

                            Your area may prohibit disposal and/or require recycling. Some states and local jurisdictions have more stringent regulations than U.S. EPA does and may require that you recycle CFLs and other mercury-containing light bulbs. Visit <a href="http://search.earth911.com/" class="text-black text-decoration-underline" target="_blank">search.Earth911.com</a> to contact your local waste collection agency, which can tell you if such a requirement exists in your state or locality.

                            requirements for proper placement. Placing an Array Signal as close to the center of a room will
                            maximize the area that it will sense.</li>
