                <h4 class="tab-title-faq">How does the PlasmaTRUE<sup>™</sup> bipolar ionizer help clean the air?</h4>
                        <p>For both Aeramax Pro and Personal units:<br>The PlasmaTrue<sup>™</sup> bipolar ionizer produces clusters of positive and negative (bipolar) ions. These charged ions are dispersed into the air, and electrically charge airborne particles so that they attach to nearby surfaces and to one another and settle faster. Charging and clustering airborne particles, enhances removal by filtration. Also, the ions react with oxygen and water vapor present in the air to create free radicals. The free radicals, in turn, can create chemical changes.</p>
                        <p>For example, they damage microorganisms (e.g., bacteria, viruses, and molds) and break down odors and VOCs.</p>

                        <h4 class="tab-title-faq">Does the PlasmaTrue<sup>TM</sup> bipolar ionizer generate ozone?</h4>
                        <p>Air purifiers, like many other products (computers, monitors, copiers, ceiling fans, and more) have a normal "ozone byproduct." An acceptable level for ozone byproduct has been set in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) at a maximum 50 parts per billion (ppb). All air purifying devices must pass Underwriter Laboratories (UL) 867*.</p>

                        <p>In July 2013, Underwriter Laboratories conducted UL 867 testing procedures to determine the level of ozone byproduct generation by the PlasmaTRUE™ bipolar ionizer used in AeraMax Pro purifiers. The highest level of ozone generation observed during testing was 4.0 ppb (acceptable level for ozone is up to 50.0 ppb).</p>

                        <p>For reference, the Environmental Protection Agency developed the Air Quality Index for Ozone to give guidance to state and local air quality forecasters to assist in issuing Air Quality Index forecasts. The levels are:</p>

                        <ul class="list-unstyled without_points pl-0">
                            <li>0 – 50 ppb:<span> Good</span></li>             
                            <li> 51 – 100 ppb:<span>Moderate</span></li>             
                            <li>101 – 150 ppb:<span> Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups</span></li>             
                            <li>151 – 200 ppb:<span> Unhealthy</span></li>             
                            <li>201 – 300 ppb: <span> Very unhealthy</span></li>         
                        </ul>
                        <p>Cities like Houston, TX and Los Angeles, CA can have indexes of 80 to 100 ppb at different times of the year.</p>
                        <p>Note that AeraMax Personal units ship with PlasmaTrue ON; AeraMax Pro units ship with PlasmaTrue OFF. The PlasmaTrue™ feature can be turned off by pressing and holding the icon until the light turns off.</p>
                        <p>* This standard for acceptable levels of ozone byproduct is found in section 21:801.415 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) and Underwriters Laboratory (UL) standard 867.</p>
                      
					              <h4 class="tab-title-faq">Does my air purifier produce Ozone? </h4>
                        <p>For AeraMax Personal units:  The AeraMax™ DX5/DX55/DX95 Air Purifier does not create harmful ozone. The Environmental Protection Agency has National Ambient Air Quality Standards for pollutants considered harmful to public health and the environment. These standards provide public health protection, including protecting the health of "sensitive" populations such as asthmatics, children and the elderly. The AeraMax™ DX5/DX55/DX95 Air Purifier generates ozone far below the standard set by the EPA. In addition, the AeraMax™ DX5/DX55/DX95 Air Purifier is UL certified, testing well below the UL specification for ozone.</p>

                        <p>For both Aeramax Pro and Personal units:<br>
The PlasmaTrue™ Icon on your indicator screen indicates that the PlasmaTrue™ Technology is active. There is no    way for the human eye to see the effect of PlasmaTrue™. Most machines will also produce a bit of a high-pitched noise that comes from the machine when the PlasmaTrue technology is on (not 100% of the time).

                        <h4 class="tab-title-faq">Can I deactivate PlasmaTrue™?</h4>
                        <p>Yes, the PlasmaTrue™ Technology feature on the all AeraMax™ Pro and personal Air Purifier units can be turned off by pressing  and holding down on the PlasmaTrue™ icon on the touch screen display panel for approximately 5 seconds. The PlasmaTrue™ Technology indicator light will turn off, letting you know that the PlasmaTrue™ Technology feature on the machine is turned off. Please note that if you turn off the PlasmaTrue™ Technology feature, it may reduce the coverage area below the AHAM certified rating.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="tab-title-faq">What is the difference between an ionizer and PlasmaTrue™ Technology?  </h4>
                        <p>For both Aeramax Pro and Personal units:<br>
There is no difference between an ionizer and PlasmaTrue™ Technology. Ionizers use electrostatically charged plates to produce positively or negatively charged gas ions that particulate matter sticks to in an effect similar to static electricity. Some ionizers produce Ozone that can be harmful to your health; however, PlasmaTrue™ Technology has been tested and validated per the latest regulation to show that it does not generate harmful Ozone. The Environmental Protection Agency has National Ambient Air Quality Standards for pollutants considered harmful to public health and the environment. These standards provide public health protection, including protecting the health of "sensitive" populations such as asthmatics, children, and the elderly. All AeraMax™ Pro and personal Air Purifiers generates ozone far below the standard set by the EPA. In addition, All AeraMax™ Pro and personal Air Purifiers are UL certified, testing well below the UL specification for ozone.

                        <h4 class="tab-title-faq">What is the difference between an ozone generator and PlasmaTrue™ Technology? </h4>
                        <p>Ozone generators are optimized to attract an extra oxygen ion to an O2 molecule, using either a corona discharge tube or UV light. PlasmaTrue™ Technology is an ionizer, which uses electrostatically charged plates to produce positively or negatively charged gas ions that particulate matter sticks to in an effect similar to static electricity. Some ionizers produce Ozone that can be harmful to your health; however; PlasmaTrue™ Technology has been tested and validated per the latest regulation to show that it does not generate harmful Ozone. The Environmental Protection Agency has National Ambient Air Quality Standards for pollutants considered harmful to public health and the environment. These standards provide public health protection, including protecting the health of "sensitive" populations such as asthmatics, children, and the elderly. All AeraMax™ Pro and personal Air Purifiers generate ozone far below the standard set by the EPA. In addition, all AeraMax™ Pro and personal Air Purifiers are UL certified, testing well below the UL specification for ozone.</p>

                <p>ACH stands for :Air Changes per Hour: and is one of the least understood ratings on air purifiers. The ACH rating indicates how many times per hour and air purifying device can exchange the air within a room. For example, an ACH rating of 5x means that the full air volume is exchanged five times every hour. </p>
<p>All air purifiers display a Cubic Feet per Minute (CFM) number under the specifications. If you multiple the CFM by 60 (minutes per hour) and divide by 8 feet (average ceiling height). Then divide that total by the ACH rating, you'll end up with the maximum square footage number for the air purifier.
.</p>
<p><img src="img/aqm-support-faq/ach-display.png" class="img-fluid" alt="ACH - Air Changes Per Hour"></p>
               
                    <p>Air changes per hour, or air change rate, abbreviated ACH or ACPH, is a measure of the air volume added to or removed from a space (normally a room or house) divided by the volume of the space. If the air in the space is either uniform or perfectly mixed, air changes per hour is a measure of how many times the air within a defined space is replaced.</p>
                    
                     <h4 class="tab-title-faq">What should I do if my air purifier creates interferences with my radio/TV when I plug it in?  </h4>
                <p>For both Aeramax Pro and Personal units:  It should not create interferences since the machine is FCC tested and certified. Verify that the interferences are not coming from another appliance or device. To do that, unplug the air purifier and verify if this stops the interferences. If it does, try to use your air purifier further away from the device on which you observe the interferences and on a different power outlet.</p>

                    <h4 class="tab-title-faq">How often do the filters need to be replaced? </h4>
                <p>The replacement filter indicators will signal when to replace the HEPA filter(s) and/or carbon filter(s). The replacement period will vary depending on the hours of use and air quality. However, under normal operating conditions, filter life is estimated to be the following:</p>
    
                <ul>
                    <li>True HEPA Filter with AeraSafe™ Antimicrobial Treatment has an estimated average filter life of 1 year </li>
      <li>Activated Carbon Filter with Pre-Filter has an estimated average filter life 3-6 months</li>
      <li>2" HEPA filter: 2 years</li>
      <li>2" carbon filter: 12 - 18 months</li>
      <li>Hybrid filter: 1 year</li>
                </ul>
      <p><i>*All figures above vary depending on the cleanliness of your air and how frequently you use your unit.</i></p>
    <p>Please note that the original HEPA filter shipped with the units should be replaced after 12 months.</p>
    
                <h4 class="tab-title-faq">Can I use another brand of filter, or private label filters in an AeraMax Pro?</h4>
                <p><b>Aeramax Pro units:</b> No, the EnviroSmart™ sensor technology in an AeraMax Pro takes into consideration the type of filters loaded into the unit to optimize performance. Only certified AeraMax Pro filters can be read by the sensor technology. The unit will not run if its sensors do not detect the information located in certified AeraMax Pro filters.</p>
                 <p><b> Aeramax Personal units: </b>No, it is essential to only use Fellowes® AeraMax™ filters, as other types of filters will not correctly fit into your product. Other types of filters will leave some air gaps in your product, through which dirty air will be able to pass without being filtered and cleaned. Using other types of filters will dramatically reduce the efficiency of your air purifier.</p>
                 
  <h4 class="tab-title-faq">Can I wash/clean my existing filters and reuse?  </h4>
                <p>No.  Do not try to clean or wash your filters as you would send all the pollutants they captured back into the air. Simply  replace your filters with new ones and dispose of the old, dirty filters.</p>
                
                    <h4 class="tab-title-faq">What should I do if my filters look clean, but my machine tells me to replace them? </h4>
                <p>If your machine has been set up on Auto for several months and if your air has been perfectly clean, it is possible  that the filters are still relatively clean when your Filter Indicator Lights tell you to replace them. However, the filters are cleaning particles down to 0.3 microns that are not visible to the human eye, therefore even  if the filter looks clean it might contain a fairly large amount of very small particles and pollutants on its surface.</p>

                <h4 class="tab-title-faq">What is the difference between adsorption and absorption?</h4>
                <p>Absorption is the process in which a fluid is dissolved by a liquid or a solid (absorbent). Adsorption is the process in which atoms, ions or molecules from a substance (gas, liquid or dissolved solid) adhere to a surface of the adsorbent. When using "absorb", one can say that something moves inside an object. But in the case of "adsorb", something forms a layer on the surface of an object.</p>
                <p>Activated carbon filters adsorb odor and volatile organic compounds.</p>

                <h4 class="tab-title-faq">How is the product different from filters in the existing HVAC today?</h4>
                <p>AeraMax Pro is designed to complement HVAC systems by filtering air at the source of the contaminant. Also, most HVAC systems do not utilize HEPA filtration, which captures airborne contaminants as small as 0.3 microns including viruses, bacteria, and other airborne contaminants. HVAC systems may not have activated carbon filters to remove odor and volatile organic compounds, or bipolar ionizers to reduce airborne contaminants.</p>
                
                  <h4 class="tab-title-faq">Can I run my machine with only one of the filters?   </h4>
                <p>Your machine has been designed to accommodate both  Fellowes® True HEPA Filter with AeraSafe™ Antimicrobial Treatment and  Fellowes® Carbon Filter. Using the machine with only one of those filters would     dramatically reduce the efficiency of your air purifier and may result in abnormal air circulation noises, as the space left by the missing filter would allow part of your indoor air to circulate freely without being filtered.

</p>
                
                  <h4 class="tab-title-faq">Do I need to turn the unit off to change the filters?  </h4>
                <p>For both Aeramax Pro and Personal units:  No, the unit is designed to disable the fan when the filter panel/drawer is opened. Once the filter panel/drawer is  re-inserted, the unit will return to the previous state of operation.</p>
                                       
                  <h4 class="tab-title-faq">Where can I get replacement filters from?  </h4>
                <p>Filter replacements are widely sold:  check with your current supplier or on www.fellowes.com.</p>
                
                  <h4 class="tab-title-faq">What happens if I don't change my filters?  </h4>
                <p>Eventually, the filters will become clogged and the air flow going through the machine will be dramatically reduced, affecting the product's ability to properly clean the air. If there is no air flow through the product and there is an excessive amount of dirt, dust, and pollutants on the filters, the product will not be able to capture the pollutants and keep them on the filters. In this case, the pollutants may be released back into the air.</p>

            <h4 class="tab-title-faq">Where is the optimal placement of an AeraMax Pro/ Where is the best place to put my air purifier in a room?</h4>
            <p><b>Aeramax Pro:</b> Units should be installed as close to the source of the contaminant as possible, where contaminated air can be drawn directly into the filtering system. Also, by placing the unit higher on the wall, close to the ceiling (always allow a minimum of 8" space from ceiling and top of unit) the unit's powerful exhaust can circulate purified air throughout the room. The best places have 1-2 feet of free space around the product to allow for air circulation. It is NOT recommended to put your air purifier close to direct heat, a vent, or a smell source (such as next to an air conditioner, a fireplace, a fan, etc.) The direct proximity of those could have an influence on the correct functioning of your unit's AeraSmart™ Sensor. See computational fluid dynamic simulations for further insight.</p>
            
            <p><b>Aeramax Personal:</b> Units should be placed as close to the source of the contaminant as possible, where contaminated air can be drawn directly into the filtering system. Acceptable places to put you air purifier include, next to a desk, in the corner of a room, etc. The best places have 1-2 feet of free space around the product to allow for air circulation.

             </li>

            </ul>
            <p>Either the AM3 or AM4 can effectively be used depending on the type of room. Restrooms, break areas, and rooms with higher levels of contaminants should utilize the AM4 which provides higher flow rates. Conference rooms, lobby spaces, and other less used, less contaminated areas can be effectively maintained with lower flow rates provided by the AM3.</p>
                <p>To estimate the coverage needed divide the hourly air delivery rate of the unit by the total cubic feet of the room. Ideally, you will want to exchange the room's air 5 or more times per hour. For example, the AM3 has an hourly air delivery rate of 13,200 cubic feet (220 cfm x 60), the AM4 is 26,400 (440 cfm x 60).</p>

                <h4 class="tab-title-faq">Why is AeraMax Pro better suited for public and shared spaces compared to other purifiers?</h4>
                <p>AeraMax Pro has patented sensor technology that automatically adjusts the unit based on conditions in the room to optimize purification and energy efficiency. No monitoring by staff is required.</p>
                <p>Systems also have a vandal resistant design. Controls and filters cannot be accessed without unlocking the unit. The purifier filters, housing, motor, and balanced fan are all commercial-grade to hold up to the rigors of public and shared spaces.</p>
                <h4 class="tab-title-faq">Are there any clinical studies demonstrating the effectiveness of the solution?</h4>
                <p>No. However, Fellowes is pursuing multiple means of demonstrating the efficacy of AeraMax Pro. Laboratory and clinical studies are options being explored.  </p>
                <h4 class="tab-title-faq">What features on AeraMax Pro are patent pending?</h4>
               <p>The EnviroSmart™ sensor technology:</p>
               <ul>
                   <li>For its ability to control fan speed and regulate the system's air-flow based on conditions in the room.</li>
                   <li>Recognizes the type of AeraMax Pro filter that is installed in the unit and can adjust motor/fan speed accordingly to maintain consistent airflow rates.</li>
                   <li>For ability to place unit into stand-by mode to reduce energy and extend life of filters.</li>
               </ul>

                <h4 class="tab-title-faq">Our indoor air quality is checked several times a year, and the air quality is good. Why would I need an AeraMax Pro?</h4>
                        <p>Even the cleanest facilities can have multiple areas that are sources of constant contamination. Anywhere that people gather, airborne contaminants can be generated—and, unfortunately, shared. These areas include restrooms, classrooms, waiting areas, ambulatory care, day care and nursery facilities, cafeterias/break-rooms, common rooms, and crowded office cubicle areas.
                            Many of these areas, such as restrooms and cafeterias, can also be constant sources of odor.</p>
                            <h4 class="tab-title-faq">Can I use AeraMax Pro air purifiers to manage radon gas levels? </h4>
                            <p>While the activated carbon filter in the unit can adsorb numerous gases, air quality control systems are not designed for, or intended for use in, mitigation of radon in a facility. Contact a radon mitigation specialist. <a href="https://nrpp.info/" target="_blank">National Radon Proficiency Program (NRPP)</a> maintains lists of certified radon contractors, radon measurement service providers, and analytical laboratories.</p>
                            <h4 class="tab-title-faq">I have mold, can AeraMax Pro help?</h4>
                            
                            <p>Not with the source of the mold. Consult a mold remediator. For more information, contact <a href="https://www.namri.org/index.php" target="_blank">The National Association of Mold Remediators and Inspectors.</a> However, AeraMax Professional utilizes a high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter, which captures airborne germs and allergens including mold spores that are drawn into the system.</p>
