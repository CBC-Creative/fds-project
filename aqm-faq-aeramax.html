                        <p class="preg12">PlasmaTrue technology creates an electrical discharge that produces ions in the air... and those ions
                          provoke particles in the air to be charged. These charged ions cause other oppositely charged ions to
                          cluster together and become larger. When they become large enough, they fall to the floor or get caught
                          in the filter. AeraMax products use ionization to help with its filtration process's overall efficiency, purifying
                          the air even before it gets to the filter. By doing so, PlasmaTrue technology works to extend filter life.</p>

                        <p class="preg12">No. The Environmental Protection Agency has National Ambient Air Quality Standards for pollutants
                          considered harmful to public health and the environment. These standards provide public health

                          elderly. All AeraMax™ products generate ozone far below the standard set by the EPA. In addition, all

                          Regulations (CFR) at a maximum 50 parts per billion (ppb). All air purifying devices must pass Underwriter
                          Laboratories (UL) 867*.</p>
                          <p class="preg12">In July 2013, Underwriter Laboratories conducted UL 867 testing procedures to determine the level of
                            ozone byproduct generation by the PlasmaTrue™ bipolar ionizer used in AeraMax Pro purifiers. The highest
                            level of ozone generation observed during testing was 4.0 ppb (acceptable level for ozone is up to 50.0
                            ppb). For reference, the Environmental Protection Agency developed the Air Quality Index for Ozone to give

                            effect like static electricity. Some ionizers produce Ozone that can be harmful to your health; however,
                            PlasmaTrue™ Technology has been tested and validated per the latest regulation to show that it does not

                    <div class="fw-700 mb-3">What is the ACH Rating?</div>
                    <p class="preg12">ACH stands for “Air Changes per Hour” and is one of the least understood ratings on air purifiers. The ACH
                      rating indicates how many times per hour an air purifying device can exchange the air within a room. For
                      example, an ACH rating of 5x means that the full air volume is exchanged five times every hour.</p>
                   
                    <p class="preg12">All air purifiers display a Cubic Feet per Minute (CFM) number under the specifications. If you multiply the
                      CFM by 60 (minutes per hour) and divide by 8 feet (average ceiling height). Then divide that total by the
                      ACH rating, you’ll end up with the maximum square footage number for the air purifier.</p>
                    <p class="preg12">Air changes per hour, or air change rate, abbreviated ACH or ACPH, is a measure of the air volume added
                      to or removed from a space (normally a room or house) divided by the volume of the space. If the air in the
                      space is either uniform or perfectly mixed, air changes per hour is a measure of how many times the air
                      within a defined space is replaced. </p>
                      <p class="preg12">To estimate the coverage needed, divide the hourly air delivery rate of the unit by the total cubic feet of the
                        room. The CDC recommends 5 air changes per hour. For example, the AM3 has an hourly air delivery rate
                        of 13,200 cubic feet (220 cfm x 60), the AM4 is 26,400 (440 cfm x 60).</p>

                            Generally, HVAC does not run continuously in all spaces. HVAC systems stop when the room reaches
                            thermostat temperature, since they’re designed to be efficient at heating/cooling. Only 10-20% of fresh air
                            makes it into the building, while 80-90% is recirculated air. Additionally, a standard MERV-13 filter found in
                            HVAC systems provide insufficient capture rates: 50% effective at .3 microns (according to ASHRAE) vs
                            Fellowes’ H13 True HEPA filters which capture at least 99.95% of particles as small as 0.1 microns. CDC,
                            ASHRAE, and the White House all recommend adding a portable HEPA air purifier where HVAC is unable

                            surface of a liquid or solid (adsorbent). When using “absorb,” one can say that something moves inside an
                            object. But in the case of “adsorb,” something forms a layer on the surface of an object.

                            eliminating aerosolized concentration of SARS-CoV-2 by 99.9999% through a single air pass test of the
                            purifier. Fellowes partnered with Prof. A. Izzotti, part of the School of Hygiene and Preventative Medicine at
                            the University of Genoa, Italy. Experimental study on the effectiveness of AeraMax air purifiers in capturing
                            and neutralizing the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Testing was conducted using aerosolized particulate of SARS-CoV2. Aerosolized particulate was channeled directly into the inlet of the AeraMax unit and particulate
                            measured at the exhaust to measure % captured at 99.9999%. Wipe Tests completed within 5 minutes of
                            test completion on HEPA filter, filter frame and pre-filter to verify they played a role in trapping the virus.

                            fan if environment cleaning is at an acceptable level. This will save motor life and LCD life (for PC models).
                            Small/Home Office machines are not designed specifically for 24/7 operation but will continue to function
                            like any small appliance with a fan. If the AeraMax 190 for example is left in Auto mode, it will choose the
                            appropriate fan speed based on the environment and settle on a low fan speed if the environment is clean.
                            If it’s in manual mode, it will continue to operate in that mode, at that fan speed, until turned OFF.</p>

                          <p class="preg12">Use a proper extension cord. Make sure extension cords are in good condition. When using an extension
                            cord, be sure to use a cord that is heavy enough to carry the draw current needed by the product. An
                            undersized cord will cause a drop in line voltage, resulting in loss of power and overheating.

                          <p class="preg12">The table below shows the correct size to use, depending on the cord length and the product amperage
                            rating. If in doubt, use the next heavier gauge. The smaller the gauge number, the heavier the cord</p>
